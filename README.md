# VulnApp
VulnApp is a startup Colombian project sponsored by the Colombia government program called apps.co. Vulnapp is formed by security expert, programmers and industrial engineer, who wants to carry the vulnerability scanning over active network devices to the next level. We have developed a unique technology to scan and detect potential vulnerabilities in the configuration files of the network devices. You just need to download the configuration file of your network devices and upload it to our platform then you will get a detailed report including all the findings and mitigations that you need to follow to close those security holes.
Currently we are only auditing Cisco devices but in the near future, we will audit the configuration file of the most important vendors of the network security devices such as Palo Alto, Sophos, Checkpoint, Fortinet, Alcatel, Juniper.
